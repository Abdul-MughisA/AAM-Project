## Idea

### Main Information
- Adventure with a clear narrative / escape room?
- ~5 rooms (game ends once rooms passed / scope for variation?)
   - Very simple combat
   - Puzzles
   - Finding things
   - Inventory
   - Each room has a unique code
   - Progress and high scores saved in a text file
   - ***OR*** menu selector at the beginning of the game
- Can be replayed many times (with scope for some variation)
    - **Game will be the same every time**
### Stakeholders
- People I know including friends & family
- Mostly like 90s games (which I enjoy as well)
- Have completed a form detailing what games they would like to see
### Style
- Relaxing
- Refreshing
- Nostalgic
- Designed in 90s style
### Safety Net
If the game becomes too complicated, reduce game idea to a single hard room with a few combat scenes. More variation in the combat (i.e.: it wouldn't just be the same game every time).

## Analysis

### Abstract

### Research

### Requirements

[Requirements](Requirements.md)

- **JUSTIFY!**
- Split into M1, M2, S1, S2â€”this way you can refer back to them.

### Interface
- Draw
- Label
- Explain
- Justify

### Data Structures
#### Classes
- Attributes
- Methods

### Algorithms
Each algorithm needs **pseudocode**.
