# Errors

## Error 1
- Trying to implement menu
- Copied and pasted same code twice but works only the first time
- "Variable was not defined before accessed"?

## Error 2
- Testing click functionality
- Implemented a kill on click
- When clicking trees, first tree killed on click, second tree killed on hover (this problem only happens with multiple trees)

## Error 3
- Implemented drag-and-drop for certain elements
- Drag-and-drop janky and inconsistent (see tree in bottom corner)

## Error 4
- Drag-and-drop issue
- When dragging one tree over another, second tree gets clumped with first
- (see image) there is only one tree visible, but the second has lumped with the first when the first was dragged over it

## Error 5
- Conclusion screen
- Set game to go to a conclusion screen when train reaches certain location on screen
- Conclusion screen never appears
### Solution
- Set Python to print train co-ordinates
- Realised that I got X and Y flipped
- Changed code, and now works as expected
